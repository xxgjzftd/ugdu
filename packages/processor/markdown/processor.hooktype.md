## HookType type

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare type HookType = 'first' | 'sequential' | 'parallel';
```

## Remarks

- `first` means the `hook fn`<!-- -->s run sequentially until a `hook fn` returns a value other than `null` or `undefined`<!-- -->.

- `sequential` is as same as the `first` except that all of the `hook fn`<!-- -->s will be run.

- `parallel` also run all of the `hook fn`<!-- -->s but in parallel mode.
