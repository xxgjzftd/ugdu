## UserConfig.routes property

The `routes id` to [RoutesConfigProperties](./packer.routesconfigproperties.md) array map.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
routes?: Record<string, RoutesConfigProperties>;
```

## Remarks

The `routes id` is used as the generated `routes module`<!-- -->'s name. The `routes module` is a `module` which export a [BaseRoute](./packer.baseroute.md) array. The array is generated based on the project structure.

## Example

If we have such config

```
{ foo: {...}, bar: {...} }
```
Then we could code in our source code as

```
import routes from 'routes/foo'
import routes from 'routes/bar'
```
